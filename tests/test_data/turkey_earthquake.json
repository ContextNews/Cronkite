Turkish authorities have declared a Level 4 emergency, the highest level, mobilizing all available resources.\n\nPresident Erdogan addressed the nation, calling it \"the largest disaster in our history since 1939.\" He announced that search and rescue teams from across the country were being deployed to the affected regions.\n\nThe earthquake's shallow depth of just 17.9 kilometers amplified its destructive power, causing buildings to collapse across at least ten provinces. Videos on social media showed entire apartment blocks reduced to rubble.\n\nInitial casualty figures reported by the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) indicated over 2,000 confirmed deaths, but officials warned this number was expected to rise significantly as rescue operations continued.",

    "text": "In what rescuers are calling a miracle, a ten-day-old baby was pulled alive from the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, 128 hours after the earthquake struck.\n\nThe infant, named Yağız, was found still connected by umbilical tissue to her mother, who did not survive. Rescuers heard the baby's faint cries while searching the debris.\n\n\"We couldn't believe it when we heard a baby crying,\" said rescue team member Ahmet Çelik. \"We worked for hours with extreme care to reach her. When we pulled her out alive, everyone was in tears.\"\n\nThe baby was transported to Ankara for specialized medical care. Doctors reported she was dehydrated and hypothermic but in stable condition. \"Her survival is medically remarkable,\" said Dr. Nilgün Tanır.\n\nYağız's rescue captured global attention and provided a moment of hope amid the tragedy. Messages of support poured in from around the world.\n\nThe baby's father also survived and has been reunited with his daughter. Extended family members have come forward to help care for the infant, whose story has become a symbol of resilience in the face of disaster.",

The airline has prioritized cargo capacity for humanitarian supplies on all flights to the region.\n\n\"Our aircraft are in service of our nation during this difficult time,\" said Turkish Airlines CEO Bilal Ekşi. \"We will do everything possible to support the relief effort.\"\n\nThe company has also donated 100 million Turkish lira to disaster relief funds and is allowing customers to contribute air miles to the effort. Donated miles will be converted to cash for relief organizations.\n\nOther Turkish transportation companies have followed suit, with bus operators and ferry services offering free passage for earthquake victims and their families.",

    "summary": "Experts say the Turkey disaster should serve as a warning for Istanbul, which sits on a fault expected to produce a major quake.",
    "text": "Seismologists are warning that Istanbul should treat the southeastern Turkey earthquake as a stark reminder of its own vulnerability, with a major earthquake on the North Anatolian Fault considered overdue.\n\nThe 16-million-person metropolis sits near a segment of the North Anatolian Fault that has not ruptured since 1766. Based on historical patterns, scientists estimate a greater than 60% probability of a magnitude 7.0 or larger earthquake affecting Istanbul within the next 30 years.\n\n\"The question is not if but when,\" said Dr. Naci Görür, a prominent Turkish geologist. \"What we've seen in the southeast could happen in Istanbul, but with potentially far greater casualties given the population density.\"\n\nStudies estimate a major Istanbul earthquake could kill over 30,000 people and collapse tens of thousands of buildings, many of which were constructed before modern building codes.\n\nThe Turkish government has undertaken an urban transformation program to replace vulnerable buildings, but progress has been slow. Following the current disaster, officials announced accelerated efforts to assess and reinforce structures in Istanbul.\n\nCivil society groups are calling for mandatory earthquake insurance and improved public awareness programs. \"Every family should have an earthquake kit and a meeting plan,\" urged the Turkish Red Crescent.",

    "summary": "Early estimates suggest the earthquake will have severe economic consequences for Turkey, already struggling with high inflation.",
    "text": "Economic analysts estimate the Turkey earthquake could cause damage exceeding $100 billion, dealing a severe blow to a country already struggling with high inflation and currency weakness.\n\nThe affected region accounts for approximately 9% of Turkey's GDP, with significant agricultural, textile, and manufacturing output. Gaziantep alone is home to one of Turkey's largest organized industrial zones.\n\n\"The economic shock will be felt for years,\" said economist Selva Demiralp of Koç University. \"Beyond immediate destruction, the disruption to supply chains and labor markets will have ripple effects nationwide.\"\n\nThe Turkish lira weakened following the earthquake, though central bank intervention limited losses. International credit rating agencies have signaled potential downgrades citing recovery costs.\n\nReconstruction will require massive government spending, straining public finances already stressed by inflation-fighting measures. The World Bank has offered $1.78 billion in immediate support, with more potentially available.\n\nInsurance coverage is limited, with estimates suggesting only 15-20% of damaged properties were insured. This will place the burden of rebuilding primarily on government assistance and personal savings.\n\nEconomists note that post-disaster reconstruction can provide economic stimulus, but the initial shock typically causes significant short-term contraction.",

Many school buildings have been converted into temporary shelters or distribution centers for relief supplies.\n\nIn provinces less affected by the earthquake, schools have been asked to accommodate students displaced from the disaster zone. Authorities are developing remote learning options for older students.\n\n\"Education will resume when conditions allow, but the safety and wellbeing of students comes first,\" said Education Minister Mahmut Özer. \"Many students have lost family members, their homes, everything. They need support beyond academics.\"\n\nUniversities in the region have suspended the semester, with plans to extend the academic year or offer condensed summer sessions. International exchange students have been evacuated to university partners in other cities.\n\nPsychologists warn of long-term educational impacts from trauma. \"Children who experience disasters often face learning difficulties and behavioral challenges,\" said child psychologist Dr. Aylin Küçük. \"Schools will need mental health resources when they reopen.\"",

    "text": "Turkish officials have acknowledged that full recovery from the devastating earthquake will require at least a decade, with reconstruction needs far exceeding any previous disaster in the country's history.\n\nEnvironment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum outlined initial recovery plans, projecting the construction of 650,000 new housing units to replace destroyed homes. The government aims to complete temporary housing within a year and permanent reconstruction within five years, though officials admit this timeline is ambitious.\n\n\"We are talking about rebuilding entire cities,\" Minister Kurum said. \"This is not just replacing buildings but reconstructing the social and economic fabric of the region.\"\n\nThe scale of destruction has required reassessing Turkey's emergency response capabilities. Officials announced plans for expanded disaster preparation, including strategic reserves and enhanced early warning systems.\n\nInternational partners have pledged long-term support. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced a €1 billion emergency support package, while the EU is considering additional bilateral assistance.\n\nSurvivors face uncertainty about their futures. \"They tell us we'll have new homes, but when? Where?\" asked Mehmet Özcan, who lost his apartment in Kahramanmaras. \"Our whole life was there. You can't just rebuild that.\"\n\nHistorians note that earthquake recovery often takes longer than projected. The 1999 Izmit earthquake's recovery, initially planned for five years, continued for over fifteen.",
